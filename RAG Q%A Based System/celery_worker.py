"""
Celery Worker Placeholder

In this project, document ingestion is executed as a background task
using FastAPI BackgroundTasks for simplicity.

This file is intentionally kept as a placeholder to demonstrate
where Celery-based asynchronous workers can be integrated in a
production-scale setup (e.g., with Redis or RabbitMQ).
