Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an artificial intelligence technique that combines information retrieval with large language model (LLM) generation. Instead of relying only on a model’s internal knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant documents or text chunks from an external knowledge base and uses them as context to generate accurate and grounded answers.

In a RAG system, user queries are first converted into vector embeddings. These embeddings are compared against embeddings of stored document chunks using similarity search methods such as cosine similarity. The most relevant chunks are then retrieved and passed to the language model as context for answer generation.

RAG helps reduce hallucinations by ensuring that answers are grounded in factual documents rather than being generated purely from the model’s training data. This makes RAG especially useful in applications that require high factual accuracy, such as question answering systems, customer support bots, legal document analysis, and internal knowledge bases.

A typical RAG pipeline consists of several stages: document ingestion, text chunking, embedding generation, vector storage, retrieval, and response generation. During ingestion, documents such as PDFs or text files are parsed and split into smaller chunks to improve retrieval accuracy. Each chunk is converted into an embedding vector and stored in a vector database like FAISS or Pinecone.

When a user asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks based on similarity scores. These chunks are then combined and provided to a large language model, which generates a final answer using the retrieved context. This approach allows the system to stay up to date by simply adding or updating documents without retraining the model.

RAG is commonly implemented using modern backend frameworks such as FastAPI or Flask for building APIs. FastAPI is often preferred due to its speed, automatic request validation using Pydantic, and easy integration with machine learning workflows.

Overall, Retrieval-Augmented Generation improves answer reliability, scalability, and transparency, making it a powerful architecture for building real-world AI-powered question answering systems.
